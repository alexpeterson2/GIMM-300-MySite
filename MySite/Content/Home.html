						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<p> My name is Robert Alexander Peterson, but you can call me Alex. I was born 25 years ago in Boise, Idaho and have lived there almost my entire life. Before becoming a GIMM student, I was studying at the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls to be a librarian. When I was only two credits away from gaining my degree though, I discovered a rather unfortunate thing. You can't get financial aid for just two credits and they won't cover you if more than half the credits you're taking aren't neccessary for your degree!</p>
						<p> I ended up taking year long break from college and got a job working at a gas station. During this time was when I discovered an interest in programming. I began self studying C++ during my free time and found I had a lot of fun making things using code. One day, an old friend from CSI was talking to me and mentioned he had heard about a new major over at BSU that was specializing in coding and game design. That night I signed up at BSU and have not regretted it since.&nbsp;</p>
						<h1>Projects</h1>
						<p>On this site I will post a number of projects I have completed and some that I am still currently working on. Most of these project will be from Unity, but a few may come from adobe animate and other such programs. Currently, I have two Unity projects posted</p>
